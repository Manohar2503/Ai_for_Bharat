# IntelliPDF (Project Idea)

This repository is about my idea for an AI-powered PDF assistant called **IntelliPDF**.

It is **not developed yet**. Right now, this repo contains my planning documents:

- `requirements.md` (what I want to build)
- `design.md` (how I plan to design it)

## My Idea

I want to build a system that helps users understand long PDF documents quickly without reading everything manually.

## What I Plan To Build

- Upload and process large PDF files
- Generate short and section-wise summaries
- Ask questions in chat and get answers with page references
- Semantic search across PDF content
- Generate insights (key points, contradictions, useful facts)
- Convert summaries/insights into audio podcast format
- Extract images and OCR text from PDF images

## Target Users

- Students
- Researchers
- Professionals
- Anyone working with large PDFs
